# Google Summer of Code Ideas List

## Shaka Player UI Library projects

### Add close button to the UI library 

In the Shaka UI library, we’ll add the close button as part of the UI library. 

[Github Issue](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/2316)

### Add Overflow Menu Buttons to the UI Control Panel

In the Shaka UI library, currently the buttons in the overflow menu are 
different from the buttons in the control panel. We’ll allow the buttons in the 
overflow menus to be added to the control panel.

### Add Video Stats panel in UI

Similar to Youtube “stats for nerds”, we’ll add a panel to display the video 
stats as part of the UI library.

## Shaka Streamer projects

[Shaka Streamer](https://github.com/google/shaka-streamer) offers a simple 
config-file based approach to preparing streaming media. It greatly simplifies 
the process of using FFmpeg and Shaka Packager for both VOD and live content.

Live documentation can be found [here](https://google.github.io/shaka-streamer/)
.

### Support concatenation of inputs
We’ll allow Shaka Streamer to stitch together multiple inputs into a continuous 
output.

[Github Issue](https://github.com/google/shaka-streamer/issues/43)

### Add support for audio codecs
Currently Shaka Streamer only supports video codecs, and we’ll expand our 
support for audio codecs, ac-3 and ec-3.
